# MINI-IT-PROJECT

This code is a Python program for a physics learning system called "Happy Physics". It's a console-based application that provides educational resources for physics students and management tools for lecturers.

### Key Features:

1. **User System**:
   - Two types of users: Students and Lecturers
   - Registration and login functionality
   - Password recovery system using phone verification

2. **Student Features**:
   - Access to physics notes on various topics:
     - SI units and derived units
     - Standard prefixes
     - Distance and displacement
     - Speed and velocity
   - Interactive quizzes/exercises for each topic
   - Physics calculator for unit conversions and calculations
   - Comment section to leave feedback

3. **Lecturer Features**:
   - Add/remove student accounts
   - Manage questions (add/edit/delete) in the quiz database
   - View student comments/feedback
   - Add other lecturers to the system

4. **Data Storage**:
   - Uses text files to store:
     - User credentials
     - Physics notes
     - Quiz questions 
     - Student comments

### Technical Implementation:

- Object-oriented design with classes for different components
- Menu-driven interface with clear navigation
- Input validation throughout the application
- File handling for data persistence
- Text-based tables for displaying information
- Error handling for various scenarios

The project appears to be designed as an educational tool for physics students to learn fundamental concepts while providing instructors with tools to manage content and track student progress. The console-based interface suggests it's meant to be simple and accessible without requiring graphical components.
